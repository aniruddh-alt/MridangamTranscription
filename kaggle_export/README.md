# Mridangam Transcription Dataset

This dataset contains audio samples of mridangam strokes for classification and transcription tasks.

## Dataset Structure
- `/data/mridangam_stroke_1.0/`: Contains the audio files organized by stroke type
- `/code/`: Contains the Python modules for data processing and model architecture

## Usage
The main notebook provides a complete pipeline for:
1. Loading and processing the audio data
2. Creating datasets with on-the-fly processing
3. Training a CNN model for stroke classification
4. Evaluating model performance

## Model Architecture
The model uses a CNN architecture designed for audio classification tasks.
